# README for Joeasus Language

## Introduction

Joeasus is an imperative programming language that resembles the structure of Mathematica, designed for quick and efficient coding. It emphasizes conciseness while retaining clarity, and features a robust standard library that includes built-in constants, functions, and constructs for various computational tasks. Joeasus programs consist of commands and expressions, and their output is the result of the last evaluated expression, unless an explicit print statement is used.

---

## Features

- **Imperative Syntax**: Joeasus programs are written in an imperative style, meaning instructions are executed in the order they appear.
- **Conciseness**: The language supports short, expressive syntax, making programs compact and efficient.
- **Predefined Libraries**: Joeasus includes a library of constants (e.g., `CT.HW` for "Hello, World!") and numerous built-in functions that help handle common tasks.
- **Evaluation**: The result of a program is the last evaluated expression, or output from print statements.

## Core Concepts

### Variables

Variables are defined and used directly in expressions. Example:

```Joeasus
x = 5
y = x * 2
```

### Functions

Joeasus provides built-in functions for common operations. You can also define your own functions. Examples of built-in functions:

- **fib**: Generates the Fibonacci sequence.
- **sqrt**: Computes the square root of a number.
- **CT**: Provides access to constant strings, such as `CT.HW` for "Hello, World!" or `CT.Fizz` for the FizzBuzz sequence.

### Constants

The `CT` library includes predefined constants:

- `CT.HW`: "Hello, World!"
- `CT.Fizz`: The FizzBuzz sequence up to 100
- `CT.PI`: The value of Pi

## Usage

### Basic Examples

**Hello, World!**

```Joeasus
CT.HW
```

This will output the string `Hello, World!`.

**Fibonacci Sequence**

```Joeasus
fib 10
```

This will output the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]`.

**FizzBuzz Sequence**

```Joeasus
CT.Fizz
```

This will output the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 100.

**Mathematical Operations**

```Joeasus
x = 4
y = sqrt x
```

This will compute the square root of 4 and return `2`.

## Built-in Functions

- **fib(n)**: Returns the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
- **fibo(n)**: Alias for `fib`, returns the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
- **sqrt(x)**: Returns the square root of `x`.
- **CT.HW**: Outputs "Hello, World!".
- **CT.Fizz**: Outputs the FizzBuzz sequence up to 100.
- **CT.PI**: Outputs the value of Pi (3.14159...).

## Conclusion

Joeasus is designed for simplicity, speed, and efficiency. Its concise syntax, combined with powerful built-in functions and constants, allows for easy problem-solving across a wide range of domains, from mathematics to string manipulation.
